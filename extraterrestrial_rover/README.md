# Extraterrestrial Rover

Robots which can survive in extreme environments is a every present challenge many industries face such as: Nuclear, Underwater and Space. Each domain come with their own unique challenges which robotic systems must manage and cope with. 

One of CRADLE's and Jacobs main ambitions is to develop technologies for these long-lasting and demanding environments with work looking at everything from the basic components used within a system to the architecture and assurance that the system will perform.

It is key for those engineers working within the space to have the ability to develop unique solution to these harsh problems in a quick and effective way. A lot of hardware is available but who knows how it will fare in space? 

Resourcefulness and imagination to create something from a bare bones kit mixed with a little determination will see you through this challenge.

# Challenge

## <div align="center"> Create a Teleoperated Extraterrestrial Rover for Completing a Series of Tasks. </div>

## Info

Each Team will be provided with a robot kit provided by CRADLE which will have all the basic electrical components needed to create a Rover to carry out tasks taking place throughout the event.

The course has been designed to be represenative of the different scenarios which a rover might face during a mission.

### You will need to design and construct a teleoperated rover which can be controlled via an operator at a PC without view of the robot (in space you can't watch it, have to use a camera mounted on the robot ;) ). You will need to create your own chassis for the robot and design it using the parts in the kit. The final challenge will be to navigate to a series of waypoints and capture and save images of markers at each point in the quickest and most control way. Their will be additional challenges at 23:00 and 04:00.

Each kit contains:
- Arduino Uno and ESP32 Camera module
- Motor, wheels and Drive board
- Bluetooth module
- Batteries 
- Assortment of additional components

> These will be the only batteries you are given so don't drain them all before the final demo


Only 1 team can test at a time in the arena.

Useful links to information, websites and examples can be found in the [info](info) folder.

Winners will get some awesome prizes.

All kits and components need to be returned at the end of the event!


## Rules/Equipment:
- Teams will not be allowed to directly view their robot as they drive and naviagate around the course.
-	Teams can use any resources online or otherwise to help them accomplish the task. 
-	Teams are allowed to operate the robots on any table surface, on the ground away from foot traffic, or in the arena.
-	Teams are allowed to modify and add things to their robots to help improve there chances given it doesnâ€™t damage the underlining components (Extra points will be awarded to innovative software and hardware designs).
-	Teams will have access to 3D printers if they wish to use them. They will need to follow the 3D printing document on the GitHub.
-	Teams will have access to anything in the inventory which they may use in their solution.
-	Teams will have access to cardboard and wooden squares to help build their robot chassis.
