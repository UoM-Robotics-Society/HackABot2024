The Makerspace is an innovative environment that fosters creativity by bringing together individuals from diverse academic backgrounds to explore their hobbies. However, only opening in December 2022, they are still relatively new and are looking for interesting and intuitive ways they can improve the Makerspace to be the best it can be.

Here are some example issues:
- The makerspace has a maximum capcity of 50 occupants, how could we moniter this and ensure it does not exceed the limit?
- Tool Inventory: Full of a wide-range of tools that people can use, sometimes they can be hard to kepe track of. Can you think of a way in order to intutively moniter the tools?
- Sustainable Materials Recycling: With rising environmental concerns, the Makerspace want to make sure they are being as energy efficient recycling and reusing as many materals as possible. How could they track and reduce their energy consumption or possibly ensure materials are being recycled correctly?

These are just some general ideas to get you started. Think outside the box and come up with your own ideas, and with the help of Sonys Spresense Board - a low-power microcontroller perfect for IoT applications - what solutions can you create to help the Makerspace?

# Challenge

## <div align="center"> Create a solution to help the MakerSpace </div>

## Info

Each Team will be provided with Sony's Spresense Kit

### You will need produce a solution to help the Makerspace which uses the Spresense Kits. Each Team will be required to produce a small presentation which describes and demos their proposed solution, and answer some questions from the judges. The presentation can be up to a maximum of 5 minutes.

Each kit contains:
- Sony Spresense Main Board
- Sony Spresense Extension Board
- Sony Spresense Camera
- SD card

You will also have full access to the Robotics Society Inventory

Useful links to information, websites and examples can be found in the [info](info) folder.

Winners will get some awesome prizes!

All Teams get to keep their Sony's Spresense Kit but **must** return all inventory items 


## Rules/Equipment:
- Teams must use the Sony's Spresense Kit in some capacity in their solution
-	Teams can use any resources online or otherwise to help them accomplish the task. 
-	Teams will have access to 3D printers if they wish to use them. They will need to follow the 3D printing document on the GitHub.
-	Teams will have access to anything in the inventory which they may use in their solution.
