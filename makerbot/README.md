# MakerBot

The Makerspace is an innovative environment that fosters creativity by bringing together individuals from diverse academic backgrounds to explore their hobbies 
[inset speil here]

Example Issues:
- Capacity: The Makerspace has a maximum capacity of 50 occupants, therefore they are looking for a smart and easy way to identify when they have reached this limit.
- Tool Inventory: Full of a wide-range of tools that people can use, sometimes they go missing... Can you think of a way in order to intutively keep track of the tools?
- Sustainable Materials Recycyling: With rising environmental concerns, the Makerspace want to make sure they are recycling and reusing as much supplies as they possibly can to reduce their carbon footprint
- WelcomeBot: 
  

Feel free to think outside of the box and come up with your own interesting ideas!
