# 3D Printing Guidelines and Resources

Welcome to our 3D printing community! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced maker, these guidelines will help you navigate our 3D printers and create amazing prints.

## 3D Printer Safety Rules

- **Maximum Print Time**: Each team is allowed a maximum print time of 4 hours. Please be mindful of this limit to ensure fair access for everyone.

- **Printer Types**: We use two types of printers:
    - **Ultimakers**: These versatile printers are great for various projects.
    - **Bambu printers**: Specifically designed for Bambu Studio, they offer unique features.

- **Slicer Software**:
    - **Ultimaker Cura**: Download Ultimaker Cura for precise slicing and optimal print settings.
    - **Bambu Studio**: Get Bambu Studio for Bambu printer-specific slicing.

## Additional Rules

- **Filament Type**: We use PLA (Polylactic Acid) filament. Handle it carefully and store it properly.

- **Print File Submission**: Submit your print files to the Supervisor in the makerspace. Ensure your file adheres to the 4-hour print time limit.

- **Time Check**: Verify that your print job falls within the allotted time before giving it to the supervisor.

## Key Design Considerations for 3D Printing

When designing 3D models, keep the following in mind:

- **Overhangs**: Limit overhangs to angles printers can handle without additional support material.
- **Wall Thickness**: Adjust wall thickness based on printer capabilities.
- **Avoid Warping**: Use heated build plates and optimize model orientation.
- **Detail Level**: Balance detail with printability.
- **Use Digital Tools**: Leverage 3D modeling software for precise designs.
